[DRAFT]

The following is an English translation of my own [reading edition]({{site.baseurl}}/texts/reading/) and interpretation of the final authorial stage of the Saint-Dié typescript. My approach to translation is vulgar where it can be: If the original French has a particular effect on me, I bend English to achieve as much, or close. When I can't translate effect, I choose broad legible over arcane literal—except in the case of Caribbean vocabularies—and take liberties to make the English pop.

The drama depends on two tricky binaries: Black/White, and to a lesser extent, Man/Woman. Three temporalities complicate these binaries further for translation: The unfolding drama is based on the Haitian Revolution; it was written for a Martinique audience during the Vichy regime; and, I'm translating for an era of re-ascendant fascism and an American audience knee-deep in our own anti-racist and anti-patriarchal struggle. Césaire's perennial "*nègre*"—the root of Négritude—exemplifies these difficulties. The n-word in English is inexcusable—not least of which—for historical or philological reasons. I mostly chose variations of "black" to highlight the Manichean core of the drama. I use "Negro" in other cases when the white speaker is paternalistic and racist, or ventriloquizing.

*(The scene takes place in Saint-Domingue at the time of the French Revolution.)*

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- I say this country is an ulcer.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- I say this land burns.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- I warn you: woe to those who come in contact with its resin.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- I say this country devours, monstrously.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- This country is cursed.
- {:.pr} This country yawns: a mouth of empty cries, having coughed up Cuba the hookworm. 

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr} This country bites: gaping mouth of a flaming throat, flaming fangs converging on America's evil rump.

- {:.pr.i} On the margins of bounding tides, I walk on the waters of spinning Springs; I see my sentinel eyes on high. The insomnia grows steadfast like a disobedience along the free temples of the amphora woman---water jug, sprouting tempest jug, kettle.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- My hands untangle my thoughts, creepers without
- contracture
- and I salute my brotherhood whole.
- Saint-Domingue, your rivers sink into my flesh
- their tamarind snout,
- forests grow mangles from my muscles,
- the waves of my blood sing for the cays,
- I close my eyes,
- all my riches at hand,
- all my wetlands,
- all my volcanoes,
- my rivers hang on my neck like
- snakes and precious chains.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint is standing by the river's rumble... from the golden shore, a hundred warriors throw a hundred spears at him... Toussaint's chest is moonlit with scars...  

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Saint-Marc yields... proud... its walls crumble... our horses sniff the blend of gunpowder and drum in the air. 

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint, Toussaint, the day of trials has arrived... He comes... the King's messenger comes... he glides... his mouth full of promises... the serpent hisses... hisses... He holds Toussaint on the tip of his tongue...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint alone has taken the path of war. All else was quiet. The canons and muskets were quiet. Toussaint is naked... The shield of braided straw in his left hand... He stops... He crawls... He freezes, a knee on the ground... His torso unfolds like a wall... The spear is raised...

*(At this moment a magnificent procession crowds the stage: pilgrims, horses, dogs. Scents of musk and benzoin.)*

- {:.sp} First Voice of Temptation.

- My voice rumples words of silk,
- my voice exhales umbels of feather,
- my evergreen voice can dig a thousand harmonious songs
- from the hollow basins
- my eyelashed voice hones a thousand triumphant insects
- my voice, a pretty bird aflame with gold
- with muslin divine, with irresistible desires,
- my moist voice flows in streams
- of valorous doves over pebbles
- of jasper and ecbatana...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Who goes there, piercing me with silver and gold, besieging me with dangers and strange caresses?

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} I've consulted the sacred dice. I say that a royal being slumbers on a narrow bed inside of you.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I say that the Republic has hammered the world a new swing with three golden words...

- {:.sp} Second Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} Ha, ha, ha. Words, nothing but words---not just three; a thousand words, Toussaint... My dear friend, do you want money? Titles? Land? Would you like to be Field Marshall? Grandee of Spain? King... that's it... you will be King... I swear you will be King.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I take one step
- Ah. I take another.
- Allow me to dislodge the carrion and mud
- without the insult of your promises.

- {:.sp} Third Voice of Temptation.

- {:.pr.i} ... A king. What an adventure. And it's true that something in you could never be subdued: a rage, a desire, a sadness, an impatience, a contempt; in a nutshell, a violence ... And here your veins carry gold, not mud; pride, not servitude. King, you were once king ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Night feast
- wine cellar, meat
- the cleaved houses stitch together a serpent motif
- fer-de-lance and rose window
- towns jump like sheep from yellow fever
- the swollen Artibonite plays the peacock;
- on the broken dike
- windows open up ever after.
- Stop the cruising torture of paradises barred with temptations:
- a seaside campaign of rum and contraband
- splits the flat fever of days into nested suns.
- Damned, may I be damned
- to catch doublespeak on my tongue. Accomplice.
- Islands,

- I was a slave for 50 years
- and I cut the cane, and I waxed the shoes, and
- the smallest child, the master's kid,
- led this gray-haired slave, bound to obedience
- and respect;
- and I tell you,
- that which illuminates the old night of my skull,
- they are not the images of ambition, no,
- but the laughter of fire, the laughter of flowers and rivers
- your image
- more violent than a heart, more brutal than a thoroughbred
- oh, Freedom.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Bornou Sokoto, Benin and Dahomey Sikasso
- Sikasso
- I call to assembly: breasts and sky, mist
- and pearls, the sowing, the golden keys.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Martinique, Jamaica
- no mirage or mountaingem
- can lull to amnesia
- the fire blast, the rotten blood, the steel song
- fraternal depths of Jericho roses  ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} You won't escape your own law.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} My law is to run from the unbroken chain, as far as the confluence of fire that vaporizes me, that purifies me and sets me ablaze with my own amalgamated gift.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- The moon wanes funereal. The king hides. 

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I don't want to be the grain of perfume wherein the innumerable sacrifices of disarmed roses is summed up and celebrated.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.i2} You will die.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.i2} Alas. You will die.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} So be it, I will die. But naked. Intact.
- My hand in my own hand, my feet on the ground,
- {:.pr} what is this dark collapse past drownings and crowds towards the sunset? The world sinks, murdered with smokescreens, caught in the net of its own parentheses.
- Naked like water,
- naked like the unicorn gaze of noon,
- like the scream and the bite, I cleared the low fog
- from the world without recognition and without ingratitude,
- where thought does not equivocate, a flower at the heart of a butterfly.
- I want the naked world of an unstamped universe.
- A young Fouta girl gnaws at a candelabra bone

- {:.pr.i} and I am young. I am plush with youth, with a childhood from long before doors and windows, with a childhood of libations and burnt offerings across my eyes, over the hours. A dry lake hangs on my cheek, but it weeps for the trees of Judea bathed in crocuses and
- anemones
- I am naked.
- I am naked on the stones.
- I want to die.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.i2} Patience, I'm looking.
- {:.pr} My polar head swallows the glimmer of corpses, the broken helmets, the inconsolable debris, suns fat with the carnal scent of venison.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} I am not a squid. I won't spit night and ink on the night's face.
- Can you see already? ...

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.pr.i} A terrible, beautiful girl breaks her shell of disasters. Coyote shooters wake up in a merry hut of absinthe.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Come then, tapered flames, bundle of chills. Let the scent of fire throw its javelin around my head.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.i2} Nothing remains but a lost man,
- {:.pr} tragic like a palm stump in the stale uprising and the fields of gunpowder. His dusty eyes dart over a steppe with no shade or water---and he chews shade and water---a prayer he won't sell.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.pr.i} Thank you, my sister ... a prayer that he won't sell ... my cobra prayer ... my eel prayer in the forests of the sea ... my cactus milk prayer in the thickets of heaven.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.i2} ... I looked, and the bridges are severed ...
- The stars have unleashed their sandy scars.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Ha, ha
- We don't see anymore
- Ha, ha
- We are blind
- Blind by the grace of god and fear.
- Do you see nothing in the new grass?
- Nothing in the ground's churn and the
- convulsive frolic of plants?
- Nothing in the sea, right?
- I see ... I hear ... I will talk ...
- Oh, new suction of my blood by the sun
- vampire,
- Oh, assault of my rock by the corsair night
- and my dawn farted below their snouts
- its crash of midday and gulls
- Tie me up.
- Trample me. Assassinate me. Too late.
- The flushed out hours strike on the lulls 
- and the mooring lanterns;
- sniffling
- the hours strike
- and lengthen with my hands' caresses,
- the flames lengthen.
- Me too, I am a flame.
- I lengthen. I am the hour.
- I wait for the wind to speak
- the firebrand tongue in my parched throat.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My eye gleams with sovereign visions ... Toussaint makes his solemn entry into Santo Domingo ... The Cabildo hands him the keys to the city.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- It's raining ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint's word is law ... He orders and legislates.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} There are no roses: only peppers fasten their red tears. 

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} Toussaint is king ... He may not have the title, but he is surely king ... a true Lamido ... here is his Guard ... the silver helmets ignite at dusk.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- The king is cold ... The king shivers ... The king coughs.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.pr.i} Alas. Alas. Spiderlike Europe stirs its legs and the phalanges of ships ... Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.pr.i} My memories become delirious with incense and bells ... The blue Niger ... The golden Congo ... The sandy Logone ... a gallop of antelopes ... and millet pounders in the cobalt eve.

[12]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p012.html){:.pagetitle}

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} My memories bellow the kidnapping ... the shackle ... the trail in the forest ... the barracoon ... the slave ship ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} Alas. Alas.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.pr.i} I was awakened from my grand dream of violet seas and chocolate earth, and I saw a small man arrive near the clove trees. He turned the sky black, his face was a peat bog cut with dragonflies.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} You've heard ... You've heard ... Toussaint is coming. Toussaint puts his feet on the ground ... Toussaint climbs the staircase. Toussaint takes the first step. He makes the second. Toussaint is on the stoop. Step by step, Toussaint sets foot on the ditch camouflaged by slippery smiles ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} You won't stop me from speaking to my friends without eclipse
- Fat moon, bad weed, sycamore, sycamore ...
- Those are my loves, here are my hatreds
- and my voice a very wise child by your alcove.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} The idiomless river tires of the maneuvers of ash;
- the cape and the filings
- the birds and the days
- turn with a lock's creak;
- fantastic animals on the infantile horizon
- brain grazers
- rest their eyes now
- giddy from the night drunk whole.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- {:.i2} Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- I want to populate the night with a meticulous goodbye.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(distant.)*

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Violets and anemones rise at each step of my blood.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(farther away.)*

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... at each step of my voice, with each drop of my name.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(even farther away.)*

- ... Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- ... araucaria cones, cherry bouquets.

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {:.i2} I'll bring this country to the knowledge of self
- I'll acquaint this land with its secret demons
- I'll light up on craters of cymbals and heloderma
- the symphonies of an unknown, splendid hell
- infested with haughty nostalgias ...

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king rises.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- And now
- alone.
- Everything is alone
- might as well sharpen my voice
- all forsakes all
- my voice toils,
- my voice sways in the cornet of mists without crossroads 
- and I have no mother
- and I have no son.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Oh, the king rises.

[16]({{site.baseurl}}/chiens/p016.html){:.pagetitle}

- No, no, I lie. I'm afraid. I'm alone
- my forests don't have ears, nor my rivers skin
- unknown caravels roam the night
- Is it you, Columbus? Slaveship Captain? Is it you
- old pirate, old corsair?
- No response. The scree widens the night.
- Columbus. Columbus.
- Answer me, go on, answer me.
- Beautiful as the shadow lattice of two pythons at noon
- the archipelago
- turbulence of prostrate organs
- sacrifice of glass of lamps crossed on the mouth
- of tempests
- virulent battle siren, absurdly caught in the motion
- of palms and scolopendra
- it's me tonight, swearing before the assembled forest
- in rings of violent cries
- Columbus. Columbus.

- {:.pr.i} Our very presence here is enough to show the magnitude of our desire to seek a resolution. We have silenced the natural indignation in our hearts that the memory of so many acts of cruelty has aroused. And we have swept under the rug all of our revulsion and repulsion, all the customs that our philosophical minds call bias or prejudice, even though these are the binding forces of our colonial societies ...

Toussaint has constituted an army made up of Blacks from the plantations in Turpin, Flaville, Trêmes, and Noé. And what an army! Makes you shudder. Our women are suffering the most brutal outrages; they are impaling the children; planters are being sawn alive on planks.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- The race of earth, the downtrodden race is well acquainted with feet.
- Congo and Mississippi, strain out gold
- strain out blood
- the race of earth, the race of ash is on the move
- the feet on the road spit saltpeter plugs.

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- You will perish, a prisoner of snow, loneliness, and desperation.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Just like me, your master will bleed one day:
- shipwrecked
- prisoner of my Africa as I am of his Europe.
- Africa is from now on linked to his destiny ...
- Africa is a part of him
- Toussaint is a part of him, whether he likes it or not.
- I say that Africa will not let him go ...

*(At this moment, The Messenger enters through the other side of the stage.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Ah. Here is the worthy messenger of this greedy race.
- Gold and silver have woven their pale complexion
- the prospect of prey has hooked their beastly noses
- the glimmer of steel nests in their cold eyes.
- Ah. A race without velvet.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- Toussaint.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Oh, my limbs of wrecked wall
- you will not extinguish from fatigue or cold

- the minutes march around me
- like a pack of bony wolves
- like a herd of whiplashes
- like knots on a ladder of rope and bylaws
- ungovernable subject, perfect victim
- defiance glued to the waterfront
- I do not converse with the gods
- I do not heal the possessed
- I don't know the secret that killed Antiochus Epiphanes
- nor Herod the Great
- Why wait to spit on me
- the thick spit of centuries
- matured
- over 306 years
- Too late, it's too late
- my friends, I'm not here for anyone
- for anyone
- except for the flood, too waterlogged to reflect the stars
- except for the mud with burnt eyes and burnt sex
- girls run around inside my eyes rattled by alfalfa
- clacking their river clogs
- their dustless tree voices
- their long bodice of bread, of plains
- and here
- I ordered for my funeral
- a herd of wild buffaloes
- one hundred eunuchs, sacrifices, tumults
- a flight of knives, of jet, of spears, of red copper

- {:.pr} Today is a day of connivance. There are bitter days on my lips, and the small mango that falls, falls lugubriously, and the flowers resemble the buried who respond ever more feebly, but I am at peace today, and the blind she-oak signals me, and the sea smiles at me with all its dimples, and every manchineel bends and commits suicide from the propitious olive tree.

- Toussaint Louverture.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Well, here you are, worthy messenger of the superior race
- {:.pr} Full of flair, having smelled the scent of nearby treasure, our masters here have asked you to receive the revelation of our little secrets ... It's fine ... The civet does not hasten on the steps of the gazelle.

- {:.sp} The Messenger.

- {:.pr} Toussaint, I am delighted to see you back in a better mood. The consul is sending me to congratulate you, and assure you that your complete submission will not leave him indifferent.
- {:.pr} In any case, let me point out that you do not underestimate yourself: you redeem yourself for the price of a treasure.

- ... Considerable ... the treasure of the old buccaneers fattened by my foresight.

- {:.pr} Let's see, Toussaint, you lost the battle. You are defeated: there is no dishonor in recognizing it.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Toussaint is conquered; the spirit of Toussaint is not.

- You see those hills bloated with the menace of rough-necked men?
- The revolt ... my sons, those are my sons.

- It was a November night.
- We crawled through the sugarcane
- The cutlasses laughed at the stars, but we could not care less about the stars.
- The sugarcane scarred our faces with a rush of green blades
- We crawled, cutlasses in hand
- Suddenly, the commotion broke the silence.
- {: .pr} We jumped, we slaves, we dunghill, we beasts with patience hooves. We ran like madmen. Gunshots were fired ... We were striking them ... The sweat and the blood kept us cool.
- {: .pr} We kept striking among the screams, and the screams grew louder, and a great flame rose pointing east: the commons were burning, and the flame flickered softly on our cheeks.
- Then we assaulted the master's house.
- They fired from the windows.
- We forced the doors.
- {: .pr} The master's bedroom was wide open. The master's room was brightly lit, and the master was there very calm ... and we stopped ... It was the master ... I entered. It's you, Toussaint, he told me, very calm ... It was me, it was me, I told him, the good Toussaint, the faithful Toussaint, his slave Toussaint, Toussaint, Toussaint Louverture, and suddenly his eyes became two frightened cockroaches on a rainy day ... I swung, the blood spurted. This is the only baptism I remember today.

- Maybe then, father, it's my turn to complain.
- {: .pr} When the Republic offered you to raise me in Europe, the bells of your heart were ringing with joy.

- And the cold, injected down to the vein.
- {: .pr} But time passed. I found a certain peace, something like fibers untwisting, and the landscape was gentle, maternal, like a reflection on the water, and it had a measure, a decency, a restraint, along with an abandonment, the landscape, a friendship at any rate ... my blood no longer cursed, something like an undoing and a blooming.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} not so for me, the landscape poisons me with aconites from its alphabet. I too can read and the cloud is shaped like the head of that old Negro I saw on the breaking wheel in a square in Le Cap; he had slapped a White man, I was 10 years old; the low sky is a damper, the wind swells with burdens and the sobs of sweating skin, the wind is contaminated with whips and casks, and hung men populate the sky with orchis, and I see the mastiffs with bloody hair and ears ... ears ... boats

- I hate you. I hate you all.
- And my hate will not die.
- As long as the fat sun rides the old nag Earth ...
- And now the living past gets back its leaves
- the past rips like a banana leaf.
- Isaac, Isaac
- {: .pr} cataclysms on that scalped head, on that brain of larva, of cogs and clocks
- fables at random,
- scapegoats at random

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- On it, my dear. On it *(he ties up Toussaint)*

- {:.sp} The Jailer Woman.

- Lousy thief.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- What do you want from me, despicable creatures?

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- ... This treasure ... where did you hide it ... your booty?

- {:.sp} The Jailer Woman.

- Thief! Thief! ... We have information ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Who is this woman insulting me?

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- Answer us, you Black bastard ... there's no time to waste.

- {:.sp} The Jailer Woman.

- Hit him, hit him ... it will do his foul skin some good ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Who are you, woman?
- {:.pr} I have known women; breasts caught by surprise on the pastures, young elephants going to mass.

- {:.sp} The Jailer Woman.

- Ouch! The pig! He insults me, the bastard. He insults me, you hear?

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- Insolent, disgusting, libidinous monkey!

*(The man hits him. The woman hits him too.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr.i} King Toussaint ... Repeat after me: "King Toussaint." King Toussaint brought down the English. King Toussaint overthrew the Spaniards ...

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- {: .pr.i} Would you look at that. He doesn't give a fuck, this monkey ... Of course he feigns madness ... harder ... even harder *(he hits Toussaint)*.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} Strike ... strike, commander ... strike until you draw blood ... a race without groans was born from the furrow ... strike and tire yourself.

- {:.sp} The Jailer Woman.

- {: .pr} Chump! What a chump! This is a chump I tell you ... a strange race, these Negroes ... Do you think our blows hurt him ... in any case, it doesn't leave a mark.
- ... *(she hits.)* Oh! Oh! He's bleeding!

- {:.sp} The Prison Guard  *(laughing.)*

- Everyone knows: a good smacking does a Negro good ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} Isaac, Isaac, why stay in the rain ... I had a son ... I managed to protect him from the bites of this race of scorpions ... Isaac, Isaac!

- {:.sp} The Jailer Man.

- {: .pr} Ah! he is seriously going off the rails ... I could die laughing ... Hey, that's funny, the red blood on the black skin. *(They loosen Toussaint.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint *(jumping up.)*

- cut hands ... squirting brain ... soft carrion ... Isaac,
- Isaac ... why stay under the rain of poisonous scorpions?
- {: .pr} the anteaters lost in time lapping aquamarine ants on city pavements. The opossums seek a red tree, a silver tree between the joints of the equinox ... a drive convulses in the mastic, muddied by fatalities and the hide-and-seek of glow worms. Isaac! Isaac! 

*(He collapses moaning.)*

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {: .pr} What a night! the snow! As if the night and the snow were caught in mortal combat: large masses of shadow collapse along with the whole panel of the sky, and the cavalry of flakes rushes down in the whipped flight of its one hundred thousand burnous.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {: .pr} The snow! it's snowing! first night of snow! the first snow hollows out the night with its precious fingers, hollows out death with its vengeful fingers, hollows out the bowl of nights with its holy milk.

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {: .pr} Amen! the snow bites; the snow sinks its burning fangs on a solemn night.

*(At this moment a vision of an endless white road: a lantern flickers; a form slowly appears. It is The Holy Virgin. She walks forward, stops and studies Toussaint, contemplating him at length.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- Humph! What is it ? Who wakes me up?
- Who comes to trouble me at the doorsteps of rest?

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- {:.i2} ... My son.

- {:.sp} The Chorus *(whispering.)*

- It's the Holy Virgin! It's the Holy Virgin!

*(the wind brings with it fragments of spirituals from afar.)*

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- ... You are also my son!

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr} So I am your son also ... look ... look closer ... daughter of the snow, look at my face, this carved block of night!

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- {:.i2} My son, my son.

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr.i} I am not your son. I am the son of the Earth however, the brother of the Sun however, the brother of the Night and its millions of stars however. I am not your son ... I'm afraid ... my throat burns. Mother! Mother!

- {:.sp} The Holy Virgin.

- {: .i2} Your suffering, my child, was indispensable to me ...

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

- {: .pr.i} Ah! you needed a naked son, a son betrayed and sold, a son covered in spit ... and you chose me ... Thanks! So you needed man's sweat, man's blood, man's moans ... man's despair and you asked us! Thanks ...
- {: .pr.i} And when we were tired, broken, exhausted, crushed, our only julep and balm the sneer of the whip, the barking whip and the wild bite, and acid dripping on our flesh, brutalized with humiliation. Thanks, mom. 
- {: .pr.i} And they needed---didn't they?---those who sent you, they needed more than my defeat, more than my chest breaking, more than my blood decomposing, they needed my acceptance ... they needed my yes, and then they sent you ... go away, cruel mother ... I despise you, go away ... leave empty handed ... or rather, take this bag of words ... the words of Toussaint, the last perhaps, the last ... no doubt, and bring them to your filthy brood.
- {: .i2} Oh, white men, my brothers
- our twisted specters will come to haunt your banquets
- {: .pr} null and obscene, we will place our scandalous faces in the midst of your celebration.
- our shouts will disturb your victories
- {: .pr} and in the nights of defeat, you will see us standing at your crossroads, Black, terrible, silent ... and you will be ashamed ... and you will be afraid ...

*(The vision gradually disappears.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint *(haggard)*

- {: .pr} ... A rumor of chains of shackles rises from the sea ... a gurgling of those drowned on the green belly of the sea ... a lash of fire, a crack of the whip, the cries of the murdered ...
- ... the sea burns
- or it's the tow in my blood that burns ...
- {: .pr} Oh, the scream ... always that fanning howl from the mountains ... and the rut of fire and drums, and the wind swells in vain with the tender smells of a musty ravine, of breadfruit trees

- of sugar mills, of bagasse pestered by gnats ...
- Mother Earth, I understood your cloak and dagger language
- my brothers the maroons champing at the bit
- my brothers the feet beyond the fence and in the torrent
- my sister the shooting star, my brother the crushed glass
- my brother the blood kiss of the head cut on the silver platter
- and my sister the epizootic and my sister epilepsy
- my friend the kite,

- every drop of blood explodes in the tubing of my veins
- and my brother the volcano with the pistol belly
- and my brother the precipice without a balisier ramp
- and my mother madness with herbs of smoke and heresy
- by the feet of Crusade and of stick
- by the hands of overwintering and of never

*(Toussaint begins to walk, to crawl, to run inside imaginary bushes, naked warriors leap, a djembe beats in the distance.)*

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {: .pr.i} Oh, the dance of the nameless stars ... the savannas come alive ... the rains smoke ... unknown trees fall reduced by lightning.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {: .pr.i} What is she saying? What is she saying?

*(At this moment Toussaint straightens up.)*

- {:.sp} Toussaint.

 - {: .pr.i} The caterpillars seek refuge in the cotton caps ... The Earth's firepit is extinguished ... it's fine ... But the sky chews betel ... Ha ha! The sky sucks daggers ... King of Malaysia and fevers full of insects, chew your kris and your betel ... Isaac, Isaac, a bullet rusts on your White smile ... Ouch! I walk on barbed stars. I walk ... I assume ... I embrace ...

*(Toussaint collapses, arms outstretched, chest against the ground.)*

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- {:.i2} Saint-Domingue, Saint-Domingue.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.pr.i} Saint-Domingue, the secrets locked under a throat twist rise in the blood steeple. Possessed women lay their soapy hands in the four corners of the red-heart marsh; the new thirsts flow out, broken moons right on the water loaf, a stone on the forehead.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Woman.

- {:.pr.i} Kohol without languor, the jaded, empty-doored atmosphere miraculously holds a sneer of precious annato. A compass dies of convulsion in the moorlands, a bowl of milk at the end of the world.

- {:.sp} The Reciter Man.

- {:.i2} Killers stream down the forests, gushing with fountain laughter
- unmarked rivers plotting the fleshy adventure of virulent travels
- nomadic blood flirting with death and genesis
- refuse from the bottom of pierced stones, and from the night of ages
- the deadly laughter of cavernous mummies

- {:.sp} The Chorus.

- Saint-Domingue! Saint-Domingue!

*(The scene has changed abruptly. We are in Saint-Domingue in front of the walls of Le Cap besieged by the Black army of Dessalines ... cannon shots ... smoke ... pieces of collapsed wall ... a Black General on horseback is surrounded by a large number of officers ... armed troops ready to move.)*

*(A head appears on the rampart. The man stands up. He is "The Negrophobe.")*

- {:.sp} The Negrophobe.

- {: .pr} Bastards! Death to the thieves! (Animals with no souls to save, and to whom the whip lends from time to time the semblance of conscience.) Thieves! Thieves! Arms in hand, I claim my property, my herd, my legitimate possession, my slaves!

*(Noise of musketry; the Negroes fire; The Negrophobe falls, and is immediately replaced by "The Negrophile.")*

- {:.sp} The Negrophile *(gesturing to the void.)*

- {: .pr} Ha! my friends, my dear friends! And the gospel said that he who hates his brother will live in darkness. Oh, my friends who live in the darkness, in the darkness of your skin, in the darkness of your hearts, I want to bring down milk, a ray of light ... of love. And I will not stop calling you "my friends," my friends, my brothers.

- {:.sp} The Echo.

- ... my brothers, my brothers ...

- {:.sp} The Negrophile *(preaching in the desert).*

- {: .pr} My friends, my friends: I grant you that slavery is a great iniquity, but by slavery you have suffered. And the suffering has allowed you to grow. And the suffering has made you human. Don't forget that, my friends, my brothers.

- {:.sp} The Echo.

- Don't forget, don't forget.

- {:.sp} The Negrophile *(striking with his sword in the water.)*

- Peace, peace, love, love.

- {: .pr} I will build with sky, birds, parrots, bells, scarves, drums, light smoke, furious tenderness, copper tone, mother-of-pearl, Sundays, rackets, childish words, words of love, love, mittens
- with children
- a world, our world
- my world with round shoulders
- with wind, sun, moon, rain, full moon
- a world of little spoons
- of velvet
- of gold lamé
- of hilltops, of valleys, of petals of cries of startled fawn
- One day
- once upon a time
- sisters, equals, will take each others' hands in the torture chambers
- and the world will gently lean down its horned head to die

- days tidy as an orphanage going to Mass
- days with the swing of a well-mannered assassin
- will be robbed of milk, of herbs and hours
- with their expressions of wild cherry
- with their galley manners on the swans' route
- with the airs of a familiar castle

- at the red hour of stirrup leather
- at the red hour of drowning
- at the red hour of nostalgia
- at the hour undone red
- at the red hour of crowds
- shoulders of boiling water, our scarred asses began to call for revenge;
- at the red hour of miracles
- freedom queen of the night hatched from the duckboard and manure of cut-off legs
- caterpillars roared on the bridge
- and our legs screamed victory
- and the broken moats answered with revenge
- with her barbs of stars
- with her eyes of stars, her breasts of stars
- her cherries of stars which she rained down on us at full valve
- and death was not surly
- but sweet
- in the hands of rosewood breasts and of young nubile girl

- and with chance and with knowledge

- with lanceolate butrops and fires
- to defeat the scrofulous example of the poultices.
