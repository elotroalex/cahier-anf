## Notebook For A Return to The Birthplace

by Aimé Césaire

<br>

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, burgeoning with feeble coves, the Antilles aching with hunger, the Antilles scarred by the pox, the Antilles wrecked by alcohol, stranded in the mud of this bay, ominously washed up in the dust of this town.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the extreme, treacherous, bleak bedsore on the wound of the waters; the martyrs who don't bear witness; the flowers of blood that wilt and scatter in the useless wind like the cries of babbling parrots; an old life smiling deceptively, its lips parted by abandoned anxieties; an old poverty silently rotting under the sun; an old silence bursting in lukewarm pustules---

- {:.pr.i} the awful pointlessness of our reason for existing.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, on this flimsiest pile of earth, exceeded by its grandiose future in humiliating ways---the volcanoes will erupt, the naked water will wash away the ripe spots of the sun and there will only remain a lukewarm bubbling pecked by seabirds---the beach of dreams and the insane awakening

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, this flat town---spread out, fumbled by its common sense, inert, breathless under the geometric burden of its eternally renewed cross, rebellious to its fate, mute, thwarted anyway, incapable of growing from the juice of this earth, embarrassed, cropped, reduced, broken with flora and fauna.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, this flat town---spread out...

- {:.pr.i} And in this inert town, this howling crowd so astonishingly exceeded by its cry like this town beside its movement, its sense, without anxiety, beside its true cry, the only one that one would have liked to hear because you know it's the only one that's truly theirs; because you feel it living within them in some deep refuge of shadow and pride, in this inert town, this crowd beside its cry of hunger, misery, revolt, hatred, this crowd so strangely talkative and yet mute.

- {:.pr.i} In this inert town, this strange crowd that does not crowd together, that does not mix: skillful in discovering the point of disenchantment, of flight, of evasion. This crowd that does not know how to crowd, this crowd, we realize, so perfectly alone under this sun, like a woman, who one would believe was solely focused on the lyrical cadence of her rear end, suddenly calls out a hypothetical rain and orders it not to fall; or a quick sign of the cross without a visible motive; or the suddenly serious animality of a peasant woman, peeing standing up, legs spread apart, stiff.
- {:.pr.i} In this inert town, this desolate crowd under the sun, not participating in anything that is expressed, asserted, or released out into the open in this land of his. Not in the Empress Josephine of the French dreaming high up above the Negro. Nor in the Liberator frozen in his liberation of bleached stone. Nor in the conqueror. Nor in this contempt, nor this freedom, nor this audacity.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, this inert town and its beyond of lepers, of consumption, of famines, of fears lurking in the ravines, of fears perched in the trees, of fears dug in the ground, of fears adrift in the sky, of fears piled up and its fumaroles of anguish.
When the daybreak ends, the forgotten hillock, forgetting to jump.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the dismal hillock with restless and docile hoof---its malarious blood drives away the sun with its overheated pulses.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the hillock's bottled up blaze, like a sob gagged on the verge of its bloodthirsty explosion, in search of an ignition that conceals and misrecognizes itself.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the hillock crouching in front of the bulimia, on the lookout for lightning and mills, slowly vomiting up its human fatigue, the hillock alone and its blood spilled, the hillock and its bandages of shade, the hillock and its channels of fear, the hillock and its large hands of wind.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the starved hillock and no one knows better than this bastard hill why the suicide choked with the help of his hypoglossus, twisting its tongue to swallow it; why a woman seems to be floating on the Capot River (her luminously dark body obediently arranged around the navel's commands) but she is just a bundle of sonorous water.

- {:.pr.i} And neither the teacher in his class, nor the catechism priest will be able to get one word out of this sleepy little boy, despite both of their energetic ways of drumming on his shaved little head, for it is in the swamps of hunger that his starved voice lies bogged down (one-word-one-word and we-can-move-on-from-Queen-Blanche-of-Castile, one-word-a-single-word, do you-see-this-little-savage-who-does-not-know-a-single-one-of-God’s-Ten-Commandments),
- {:.pr.i} because his voice is lost in the swamps of hunger,
- {:.pr.i} and there is nothing, nothing really you can get out of this little rascal,
- {:.pr.i} other than a hunger that no longer knows how to climb the rigging of its voice,
- {:.pr.i} a hunger deep and anemic,
- {:.pr.i} a hunger buried in the depths of the Hunger of this starving hillock.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the motley shipwreck, the exacerbated stench of corruption, the monstrous sodomies of the victim and the flogger, the insurmountable bow of prejudice and foolishness, prostitution, hypocrisy, lewdness, betrayals, lies, falsehoods, concussions---the breathlessness of insufficient acts of cowardice, effortless enthusiasm for supernumerary sprouts, greed, hysteria, perversions, harlequinades of misery, cripples, pruritus, urticaria, the lukewarm hammocks of degeneration. 
- {:.pr} Here's the parade of laughable and scrofulous buboes, the culture of freaky microbes, the poisons without known remedies, the pus of ancient wounds, the unpredictable fermentations of putrescible species.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the great still night, the stars, more dead than a broken balafong,

- {:.pr.i} The teratic bulb of the night, sprouted from our baseness and our renouncings …

- {:.pr.i} And our foolish and mad gestures to revive the splash of gold of favored moments, the umbilical cord restored to its fragile splendor, the bread, and the wine of complicity, the bread, the wine, the blood of true weddings.

- {:.pr.i} And this ancient joy bringing me knowledge of my present misery, 
- {:.pr} a bumpy road that takes a dip in a hollow where it scatters a few shacks; an indefatigable road which charges at full speed a hillock, on top of which a madly ascending road is brutally stuck in a pool of clumsy houses, recklessly descending, and the carcass of wood comically perched on tiny cement legs that I call "our house", its tin hairstyle waving in the sun like dry skin, the dining room, the coarse floor where nailheads glisten, the beams of pine and shadows that run up to the ceiling, the chairs of ghostly straw, the gray light of the lamp, fast and glazed with cockroaches which buzz so much they hurt…

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, this most essential country restored for me to gorge on, not with diffuse tenderness, but with the tormented, sensual concentration of the hillocks' fat nipple and the accidental palm tree as their hardened seed, the torrents' saccadic orgams, from Trinité to Grand-Rivière, the hysterical grand-lick of the sea. 

- {:.pr.i} And time was passing quickly, very quickly.
- {:.pr.i} Gone by August when the mango trees flaunt all their lunula, September the midwife of hurricanes, October the torcher of sugarcane, November purring in the distilleries, and Christmas was beginning.
- {:.pr.i} Christmas announced itself first with a tingling of desires, a thirst for new tenderness, a budding of imprecise dreams, then it suddenly took flight in the purple rustle of its great wings of joy, and then its dizzying fall landed on the town, bursting life from the shacks like an overripe pomegranate.
- {:.pr.i} Christmas wasn't like the other holidays. It didn't like running down the streets, dancing in public squares, riding on wooden horses, taking advantage of the crowd to pinch women, throwing fireworks at the brow of tamarind trees. Christmas had agoraphobia. What it needed was a whole day of busyness, of getting ready, cooking, cleaning, worrying, for-fear-that-there-won't-be-enough,
- {:.pr} for-fear-that-we’ll-run-out,
- {:.pr} for-fear-that-we’ll-get-bored,
- {:.pr} then in the evening a small church, nothing imposing, allowing itself to be benevolently filled with laughter, whisperings, confidences, romantic declarations, slander, and the guttural cacophony of a singer in great shape, and good buddies and plainspoken wenches too, and shacks with their bowels full of delicious treats, and not persnickety, and about twenty of us parked there, and the streets are deserted, and the town is nothing but a bouquet of songs, and we are just fine inside, and we're eating good, and we drink some cheer and there is sausage, the narrow kind that resembles two fingers intertwined like a volubile, the broad and squat one, the benign one that tastes of wild thyme, the violent one with its spicy incandescence, and hot coffee and sweet anise and milk punch, and the liquid sun of rums, and all kinds of good things that forcefully impose your mucous membranes on you or melt them into you full of subtleties, or distill them to you in raptures, or weave them with fragrances, and we laugh, and we sing, and the refrains fuse as far as the eye can see like coconut palms:
- {:.pr.i} ALLELUIA
- {:.pr.i} KYRIE ELEISON … LEISON… LEISON,
- {:.pr.i} CHRISTE ELEISON… LEISON… LEISON.
- {:.pr.i} And it is not only mouths that sing, but hands, and feet, and buttocks, and the genitals, and the whole creature liquefies into sounds, voice, and rhythm.
- {:.pr.i} At the top of its ascent, joy bursts like a cloud. The chants do not stop, but they now roll restless and heavy through the valleys of fear, the tunnels of anguish, and the fires of hell.
- {:.pr.i} And each one of us begins to pull the nearest devil by the tail, until fear dissipate imperceptibly in the fine sand of dreams, and we begin to live as if in a real dream, and we drink and we cry out, and we sing as in a dream, and we also doze off as in a dream with eyelids turned into rose petals, and the day comes on velvety like a sapodilla, and the smell of manure from the cocoa trees, and the turkeys, which spread their red pustules to the sun, and the obsession with bells, and the rain,
- {:.pr.i} the bells ... the rain ...
- {:.pr.i} that jingle, jingle, jingle ...

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, this flat town---spread out ...
- {:.pr.i} She crawls on her hands without ever wanting to cross the sky with a protesting stance. The backs of the house are afraid of the sky strewn with fire, their feet fear drowning in the ground. They have chosen to place themselves superficially between surprises and treacheries. And yet she moves forward, the town. She even grazes more and more every day beyond the tide of tiled corridors, prudish shutters, sticky courtyards, paintings dripping. And little hushed up scandals, little shames silenced, immense little hatreds knead into bumps and hollows the narrow streets where the stream grimaces longitudinally among the turds ...

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, life, prostrate, we know not where to send our aborted dreams, the river of life desperately torpid in its bed, without turgescence or depression, uncertain where to flow, lamentably empty, the heavy impartiality of boredom, doling out darkness over all things equally, stagnant air without a clear bird opening.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, another small black house which smells very bad, on a very narrow street, a tiny house that shelters in its bowels of rotten wood dozens of rats and the turbulence of my six brothers and sisters, a cruel little house whose intransigence maddens our end of the month and my unpredictable father eaten away by a sole misery, I never knew which, that some unforeseeable witchcraft sends off into melancholy tenderness or fires up in roaring flames of anger; and my mother, whose legs pedal, pedaling by day, by night for our tireless hunger; I am even awakened at night by those tireless legs pedaling at night and the harsh bite of a Singer sewing machine into the soft flesh of the night, and my mother pedaling, pedaling for our hunger, day and night.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, beyond my father, my mother, the hut chapped with sores, like peach leaf curl, and the tapered roof, patched with pieces of oil can, and the swamps of rust in the stinking, sordid gray paste of straw, and when the wind whistles, these odds and ends make a strange noise, like the crackle of frying at first, then like a branding iron plunged in water with the twig smoke taking flight ... And the bed of planks from which my race arose, my whole race arisen from a bed of planks, with its legs made of kerosine containers, as if it had elephantiasis that bed, and its goat skin, and its dried banana leaves, and its rags, the nostalgia of a mattress that is my grandmother's bed (Above the bed, in a pot full of oil, a candle whose flame dances like a large cockroach ... inscribed on the pot, in golden letters: THANK YOU).

- {:.pr.i} What a shame, this Straw street,
- {:.pr} a disgusting appendage, like the shameful parts of the town, stretching right and left all along the colonial road, the gray swell of its "wood shingle" roofs. Here there are only straw roofs that the sea spray has browned and the wind plucks away.
- {:.pr.i} Everyone hates Straw street. This is where the town's youth debases itself. It is here above all that the sea pours out its filth, its dead cats and its dead dogs. Because the street leads to the beach, and the beach is not enough for the foaming rage of the sea.
- {:.pr.i} This beach is trouble too, with its rotting heaps of rubbish, its furtive backsides relieving themselves, and the sand is black, funereal, you have never seen such black sand, and the foam slides over it with a yelp, and the sea hits it with great boxing blows, or rather the sea is a big dog that licks and bites the beach at along its hamstrings, and by dint of biting it it will end up devouring it, of course, the beach and Straw street right along with it.

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends, the wind of bygone days rises up, of betrayed loyalties, of uncertain duty that slips away and that other early morning, Europe …

- {:.pr.i} To leave. My heart swelled with emphatic bounties. 
- {:.pr} To leave ... I would arrive smooth and young in this land of mine, and I would say to this land whose silt is part of the composition of my flesh: "I have wandered for a long time, and I return to the deserted hideousness of your wounds."
- {:.pr.i} I would come to this land of mine and tell it. 
- {:.pr} "Kiss me without fear… And if speaking is all I know how to do, I will speak for you. "
- {:.pr.i} And I would tell it again:
- {:.pr} "My mouth will be the mouth of misfortunes that have no mouth, my voice, the freedom of those who collapse in the dungeon of despair. "
- {:.pr.i} And coming I would say to myself:
- {:.pr} “And above all, my body, as well as my soul, be careful not to fold your arms in the sterile attitude of the spectator, for life is not a spectacle, and a sea of sorrows is not a proscenium, for a screaming man is not a dancing bear… ”.

- {:.pr.i} And now I have arrived!

- {:.pr.i} Again this hobbling life before me, not this life, this death, this death without meaning or piety, this death where greatness fails pitifully, the dazzling smallness of this death, this death that hobbles from minutiae to minutiae; those lumps of small-time avarice shoveled onto the conquistador; those lumps of small-time minions shoveled onto the Great Savage; those lumps of small-time souls shoveled onto the three-souled Caribbean.
- {:.pr} and all these deaths futile
- {:.pr} absurdities under the splash of my open consciousness
- {:.pr} tragic, enlightened futilities of this one noctilucus
- {:.pr} and me alone, the sudden scene that is this dawn
- {:.pr} where the apocalypse of monsters preens
- {:.pr} then, capsized, becomes silent
- {:.pr} hot election of ashes, ruins, and subsidence

- {:.pr.i} ---One more objection! only one, but please only one: I am not allowed to calculate life based solely on my fuliginous span; to reduce myself to this little ellipsoidal nothing, trembling four fingers above the line, meI, a man to thus upset creation, that I see myself between latitude and longitude!

- {:.pr.i} When the daybreak ends,
- {:.pr} the manly thirst and the stubborn desire,
- {:.pr} here I am divided from the cool oases of brotherhood
- {:.pr} this modest nothing frieze of hard splinters
- {:.pr} this all-too-sure horizon trembles like a jailer.
	
- {:.pr.i} Your last triumph, stubborn crow of Betrayal.
- {:.pr.i} What is mine, those few thousand mortals circling in the calabash of an island, and what is also mine, the archipelago  archedlike the uneasy desire to deny itself, it looks like a maternal anxiety to protect the more delicate tenuity separating one America from the other; and its flanks that secrete for Europe the good liquor of a Gulf Stream, and one of the two incandescent slopes between which the equator tightrope walks towards Africa. And my non-enclosed island, its bright audacity, upright behind this Polynesia, in front of it, Guadeloupe split in two with its dorsal stripe and our same misery, Haiti where negritude stood up for the first time and said that she believed in her humanity and the comical little tail of Florida where the strangulation of a Negro is completed, and Africa, gigantically crawling to the Hispanic foot of Europe, her nudity where Death carves out wide furrows.
	
- {:.pr.i} And I say to myself Bordeaux and Nantes and Liverpool and New York and San Francisco
- {:.pr} not a corner of this world that does not have my fingerprint and my calcaneus on the back of skyscrapers and my filth in the sparkling of gems!
- {:.pr} Who can claim to have better than me?
- {:.pr} Virginia. Tennessee. Georgia. Alabama.

- {:.pr} Monstrous putrefactions of ineffective revolts,
- {:.pr} putrid blood swamp
- {:.pr} absurdly clogged trumpets
- {:.pr} Red lands blood lands consanguineous lands.

- {:.pr.i} What is also mine: a small cell in the Jura,
- {:.pr} a small cell, the snow the double of white bars
- {:.pr} the snow is a white jailer who stands guard in front of a prison
- {:.pr} What is mine
- {:.pr} a lonely man imprisoned in white
- {:.pr} a lonely man who defies the white cries of white death
- {:.pr} (TOUSSAINT, TOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE)
- {:.pr} he is a lonely man who fascinates the white hawk of the white death
- {:.pr} he is a man alone in the fruitless sea of ​​white sand
- {:.pr} he is an old darkie standing against the waters of the sky
- {:.pr} Death draws a shining circle above this man
- {:.pr} death constellates softly above his head
- {:.pr} death blows into the ripe cane of his arms
- {:.pr} death gallops through the prison like a white horse
- {:.pr} death shines in the shadows like cat eyes
- {:.pr} death hiccups like water under Les Cayes
- {:.pr} death is a wounded bird
- {:.pr} death decreases
- {:.pr} death falters
- {:.pr} death is an umbrageous peckary
- {:.pr} death expires in a white pool of silence.

- {:.pr} Night swellings in all four corners of this early morning
- {:.pr} jolts of frozen death
- {:.pr} tenacious fate
- {:.pr} upright cries of silent earth
- {:.pr} will the splendor of this blood not burst at all?

- {:.pr.i} And now one last damnit:
- {:.pr} for the sun (It's not enough to get my hard head drunk)
- {:.pr} in the mealy night with the golden egg-laying of uncertain fireflies
- {:.pr} with a head of hair that trembles at the top of the cliff,
- {:.pr} the wind blows there in fickle salty cavalry
- {:.pr} I can read in my pulse that exoticism is not for me.

- {:.pr.i} On the way out of Europe all contorted with cries
- {:.pr} the silent currents of despair
- {:.pr} leaving a fearful Europe, resilient and pridefully overestimating itself
- {:.pr} I want this beautiful and adventurous selfishness
- {:.pr} and my plowing reminds me of an implacable prow.

- {:.pr} Nothing but blood in my memory! There are lagoons in my memory. They are covered with skulls. They are not covered with water lilies.
- {:.pr} There are lagoons in my memory. Their banks are not covered with the loincloths of women.
- {:.pr} My memory is surrounded by blood. My memory has its belt of corpses!

- {:.pr} and the strafing of rum barrels brilliantly spraying our vile revolts, swoon of gentle eyes on having swigged ferocious freedom

- {:.pr} (Negroes-are-all-the-same, I-tell you
- {:.pr} the vices-all-the-vices, I'm-telling-you
- {:.pr} the smell-of-Negroes makes-the-cane-grow
- {:.pr} remember-the-old-saying:
- {:.pr} to beat-a-Negro is to feed him)

- {:.pr} around rocking chairs meditating on the pleasures of the whip ...

- {:.pr} I turn, uneasy filly

- {:.pr} Or quite simply how they love us!
- {:.pr} Cheerfully obscene, very into Jazz for their excessive boredom.
- {:.pr} I know the tracking, the Lindy-hop and tap dancing.
- {:.pr} For the good mouths the muting of our complaints coated with wah-wah. Wait…
- {:.pr} Everything is in order. My guardian angel grazes neon. I swallow chopsticks. My dignity wallows in the puke …

- {:.pr.i} Sun, Sun Angel, Curly Sun Angel.
- {:.pr.i} For a leap beyond the green and soft swim of the waters of abjection!
- {:.pr.i} But I went to the wrong sorcerer. On this exorcised land, adrift of its precious evil intention, that screaming voice, slowly hoarsening, vainly, vainly hoarsening, and there are  only the droppings accumulated from our lies that do not respond!

- {:.pr} What madness the marvelous entrechat I dreamed of above the baseness!
- {:.pr} Oh my, the whites are great warriors
- {:.pr} Hosannah for the master and for the castrators of Negroes!
- {:.pr} Victory! Victory, I tell you: the vanquished are happy!
- {:.pr} Joyful stenches and songs of mud!

- {:.pr} By an unexpected and beneficent inner revolution, I now honor my repulsive ugliness.

- {:.pr} On St John the Baptist Day, as soon as the first shadows fall over the village of Gros-Morne, hundreds of horse-dealers meet to exchange their horses, on "DE PROFUNDIS" Street, whose name warns us frankly at least of a stampede straight from the slums of Death. And it is from Death truly, from its thousand petty local forms (unfulfilled cravings for Para grass and drunken subjugation of the distilleries) that looms large towards the great life breaks down the astonishing cavalry of the impetuous nags. And what galloping! What neighing! What sincere urine! What amazing droppings! "A beautiful horse, difficult to mount" – "A haughty mare sensitive to the wheel! " – " An intrepid colt gallantly pasterned! "
- {:.pr.i} And the clever guy whose waistcoat is crossed by a proud watch chain, who instead of full breasts, of youthful ardor, of authentic roundness, will scam you with the expected swellings of complacent wasps, or the obscene biting of ginger, or the beneficial circulation of ten liters of sugar water.

- {:.pr.i} I refuse to offer my own blisters as true glory.
- {:.pr.i} And I laugh at my old childish imaginations.
- {:.pr.i} No, we have never been Amazons of the king of Dahomey, nor princes of Ghana with eight hundred camels, nor doctors in Timbuktu when Askia the Great was king, nor architects of Djenné, nor Mahdis, nor warriors. Our armpits do not itch like those who once held the spear. And since I have sworn not to hide anything from our history, (I who admire nothing so much as the sheep grazing on its afternoon shadow), I want to admit that we have always been rather poor washers of dishes, insignificant shoe-shiners, let's get it right, moderately conscientious sorcerers, and the only indisputable record that we have broken is that of endurance under the lash …

- {:.pr.i} And this country cried for centuries that we are brute beasts; that the pulsations of humanity stop at the gates of the negro masses; that we are the hideously promising, ambulant dung of tender canes and silky cotton, and we were branded with a hot iron, and we slept in our excrement, and we were sold in the squares, and the yardstick of English cloth and salted meat of Ireland cost less than us, and this country was calm, quiet, saying that the spirit of God was in its actions.

- {:.pr} The slave ship! my sure and dark instinct proclaims
- {:.pr} the veils of black clouds, the polyrigging of dark forests and the harsh magnificence of the Calebars, souvenir badge to the whitening prow---that skeleton!

- {:.pr} I hear from the hold rising the chained curses, the gasps of the dying, the sound of one of them being thrown into the sea ... the barks of a woman in pregnancy ... the scraping of nails seeking throats ... the sneers of whip… ruffles of vermin amid weariness…

- {:.pr} Nothing could ever revolt us towards some noble desperate adventure.
- {:.pr} So be it. So be it.
- {:.pr} I am of no nationality prescribed by the chancelleries
- {:.pr} I challenge the craniometer. Homo sum etc.
- {:.pr} And they serve and betray and die
- {:.pr} So be it. So be it. It was written in the shape of their pelvis.

- {:.pr} And me and me,
- {:.pr} me who sang fist hardened 
- {:.pr} You have to know how far my cowardice went.
- {:.pr} One evening in a streetcar, facing me, a Negro.
- {:.pr.i} He was a Negro big as a gorilla trying to make himself tiny on a streetcar bench. He tried to leave behind his gigantic legs and his starving boxer’s shaky hands on that filthy streetcar bench. 
- {:.pr} And everything had left him, was leaving him. His nose, which looked like a shaved down peninsula, and his Negritude itself, discolored by the action of a tireless tanning. And the tanner was Poverty. A sudden large-eared bat whose claw marks had scarred scabious islands on his face. Or rather, he was a tireless worker, Misery working on some hideous cartridge. We could see very well how the industrious and malicious thumb had modeled the humped forehead, pierced the nose with two parallel and disturbing tunnels, lengthened the excessiveness of the lower lip, and in a stroke of caricatural genius, planed, polished and varnished the tiniest, cutest little ear in all of creation.
- {:.pr.i} He was a gangling Negro without rhyme or reason.
- {:.pr.i} A Negro with a voice foggy with alcohol and misery.
- {:.pr.i} A Negro whose eyes rolled with bloody weariness.
- {:.pr.i} A shameless Negro, and his toes sniggered quite stinkily at the bottom of the half-open lair of his shoes.

- {:.pr.i} You can't really say that Poverty had made any real effort to finish him off.
- {:.pr.i} She had hollowed out the eye-socket, had made it up with a dusting of make-up and rheum mixed together.
- {:.pr.i} She had stretched the empty space between the firm grip of the jaws and the cheekbones of an old, decaying cheek. She had planted the little glowing stakes of a days-old beard on them. She had thrown his heart into a panic, hunched his back.
- {:.pr.i} And the whole thing perfectly added up to one hideous Negro, a cranky Negro, a melancholy Negro, a slumped Negro, his hands gathered in prayer on a gnarled stick. A Negro buried in an old, threadbare jacket. A funny, ugly Negro, and the women behind me were looking at him and giggling.
- {:.pr.i} I turned, my eyes proclaiming that I had nothing in common with that monkey.
- {:.pr.i} He was COMICAL AND UGLY,
- {:.pr.i} COMICAL AND UGLY to be sure.
- {:.pr.i} I wore a big complicit smile ...
- {:.pr.i} My cowardice rediscovered!
- {:.pr} I salute the three centuries that support my civil rights and my downgraded blood.
- {:.pr} My heroism, what a farce!
- {:.pr} This city fits me well.
- {:.pr} And my soul is lying. Like this city in the dirt and in the lying mud.
- {:.pr} This city, my face of mud.
- {:.pr} The baptismal water dries on my forehead.
- {:.pr} I claim for my face the dazzling praise of spit! ...

- {:.pr} So, such as we are, with our viril fervor, the victorious knee, the coarse-clod plains of the future!
- {:.pr} Look, I prefer to admit that I have been wildly delusional, my heart in my brain and a drunken knee as well.

- {:.pr} My star now, the funeral malfini.

- {:.pr} And on this old dream my cannibalistic cruelties
- {:.pr} The balls are thick saliva in the mouth 
- {:.pr} Our heart of daily baseness explodes
- {:.pr} continents break the frail attachment of isthmuses
- {:.pr} land masses leap following the fatal division of rivers
- {:.pr} and the hillock that for centuries has held its cry within itself, it's the one who in turn tears the silence apart
- {:.pr} and this people rebounding valor!
- {:.pr} and our limbs vainly disjointed by the most refined torments, and the more impetuous life springing from this dung – like the surprise of soursop from decaying jackfruit!

- {:.pr} My cannibal cruelties on this old dream of mine

- {:.pr} I hid behind stupid vanity
- {:.pr} fate called, I was hidden behind,
- {:.pr} and here is the man on the ground! His ever so fragile defense scattered,
- {:.pr} His sacred maxims trampled underfoot, his pedantic declamations blowing wind through each wound.
- {:.pr} Here is the man on the floor.
- {:.pr} and his soul is nearly bared
- {:.pr} and fate triumphs, contemplating this soul which once defied it transform in the ancestral quagmire 

- {:.pr} I say it is all well and good.
- {:.pr} My back will successfully exploit the unwinding of fibers.
- {:.pr} I will gratefully show off my natural obsequiousness.
- {:.pr} And the silver-striped sales pitch of the Havana postilion, the lyrical baboon, mediator of the splendours of servitude, will restore my enthusiasm.

- {:.pr} I say it is all well and good.
- {:.pr} I live for the flattest of my soul. For the dullest of my flesh!

- {:.pr} Warm break of dawn of ancestral heat and fear
- {:.pr} I now tremble with the common trembling
- {:.pr} let our docile blood sing in the madrepore.

- {:.pr} And these tadpoles of my prodigious ancestry hatched within me!

- {:.pr} those who invented neither gunpowder nor compass
- {:.pr} those who have never known how to tame steam or electricity
- {:.pr} those who have not explored neither the seas nor the sky
- {:.pr} but they know every nook and cranny of the land of suffering
- {:.pr} those whose only travels have been uprootings
- {:.pr} those who have gotten used to kneeling 
- {:.pr} those who were domesticated and Christianized
- {:.pr} those who were inoculated with bastardization
- {:.pr} empty-handed djembe
- {:.pr} inane djembe with its sonorous wounds
- {:.pr} Burlesque djembe of syphilitic treason

- {:.pr.i} Warm early morning of heat and ancestral fears

- {:.pr} overboard my peregrine riches
- {:.pr} overboard my authentic falsehoods

- {:.pr} But what strange pride suddenly illuminates me?

- {:.pr} O friendly light
- {:.pr} O fresh source of light

- {:.pr} those who invented neither powder nor compass
- {:.pr} those who have never known how to tame steam or electricity
- {:.pr} those who have explored neither seas nor the sky
- {:.pr} but those without whom the earth would not be the earth
- {:.pr} gibbosity so much more beneficial than the evermore
- {:.pr} deserts the earth
- {:.pr} silo where the earth's most earthy things are preserved and ripened
- {:.pr} my Negritude is not a stone, its deafness rushed against the clamor of the day
- {:.pr} my Negritude is not a blanket of dead water on the dead eye of the earth
- {:.pr} my Negritude is neither a tower nor a cathedral

- {:.pr} it dives into the red flesh of the ground
- {:.pr} it plunges into the fiery flesh of the sky
- {:.pr} it pierces the opaque dejection of her righteous patience.

- {:.pr} Hurray for the royal cailcedrat!

- {:.pr} Hurray for those who have never invented anything
- {:.pr} for those who have never explored anything
- {:.pr} for those who have never mastered anything

- {:.pr} but they surrender, overcome, to the essence of all things
- {:.pr} ignorant of surfaces but gripped by the movement of all things
- {:.pr} uninterested in taming, but playing the game of the world
- {:.pr} truly the oldest sons of the world
- {:.pr} porous to all the breaths of the world
- {:.pr} fraternal aerie of ​​all the breaths of the world
- {:.pr} drainless bed of all the waters of the world
- {:.pr} spark of the sacred fire of the world
- {:.pr} flesh of the flesh of the world throbbing with the very movement of the world!

- {:.pr} Warm early morning with ancestral virtues
- {:.pr} Blood ! Blood ! all our blood moved by the male heart of the sun

- {:.pr} those who know the femininity of the moon with its oiled body
- {:.pr} the reconciled exaltation of the antelope and the star
- {:.pr} those whose survival walks in the germination of grass!

- {:.pr} Hurray perfect circle of the world and close concordance!
- {:.pr} 	
- {:.pr} Hear the white world
- {:.pr} horribly weary of its immense effort

- {:.pr} its rebellious joints creak under the impassive stars
- {:.pr} its stiffness of blue steel piercing the mystical flesh
- {:.pr} listen to its stupendous victories trumpet its defeats
- {:.pr} listen to its grandiose alibis its mediocre stumbling 

- {:.pr} Pity for our omniscient and naive conquerors! 

- {:.pr} Hurray for those who have never invented anything
- {:.pr} for those who have never explored anything
- {:.pr} for those who have never mastered anything 

- {:.pr} Hurray for joy
- {:.pr} Hurray for love
- {:.pr} Hurray for the pain in the udders of reincarnated tears

- {:.pr} And here at the end of this early morning my virile prayer
- {:.pr} that I may hear neither the laughter nor the cries, my eyes fixed
- {:.pr} on this city that I prophesy, beautiful,

- {:.pr} give me the courage of the martyr
- {:.pr} give me the sorcerer’s wild faith
- {:.pr} give my hands the power to shape
- {:.pr} give my soul the temper of the sword
- {:.pr} I do not shirk. Make of my head a figurehead
- {:.pr} and of myself, my heart, make neither a father nor a brother,
- {:.pr} nor a son, but the father, but the brother, but the son,
- {:.pr} not a husband, but the lover of this unique people.

- {:.pr} Make me rebellious to all vanity, but docile to its genius
- {:.pr} like the fist outstretched!
- {:.pr} Make me commissioner of its blood
- {:.pr} make me the custodian of its resentment
- {:.pr} make me a man of endings
- {:.pr} make me a man of beginnings
- {:.pr} make me a man of contemplation
- {:.pr} but also make me a man of sowing

- {:.pr} make me the executor of these lofty works

- {:.pr} now is the time to gird up these loins like a valiant man.

- {:.pr} But doing so, my heart, keep me from all hate
- {:.pr} do not make of me that man of hatred for whom I have nothing but hate 
- {:.pr} because to limit myself to this unique race
- {:.pr} and you know my catholic love
- {:.pr} and you know it is not at all out of hatred for other races
- {:.pr} that I force myself to be the glorifier of this unique race
- {:.pr} that what I want
- {:.pr} it is for the universal hunger
- {:.pr} for the universal thirst

- {:.pr} to finally summon freedom

- {:.pr} to produce out of its closed intimacy
- {:.pr} the succulence of fruits.

- {:.pr} And see the tree of our hands!
- {:.pr} it rotates for all, the wounds incised in its trunk
- {:.pr} the soil works for all 
- {:.pr} and intoxication towards the branches of fragrant precipitation!

- {:.pr} But before approaching future orchards
- {:.pr} allow me to deserve them on their sea belt
- {:.pr} give me my heart while waiting for the ground
- {:.pr} give me over to the barren ocean
- {:.pr} but where the hand strokes the promise of the tack
- {:.pr} give me over to this diverse ocean
- {:.pr} the stubbornness of the proud canoe
- {:.pr} and its marine vigor.

- {:.pr} Here it is advancing, climbing and falling onto the pulverized
- {:.pr} tide---

- {:.pr} Here it is dancing the sacred dance in front of the greyness of the village
- {:.pr} here it is trumpeting a vertiginous queen conch
- {:.pr} here is the queen conch galloping to the indecision of the hills
- {:.pr} and here after twenty vigorous plowings the paddle
- {:.pr} forcing the water
- {:.pr} the canoe rears up under the onslaught of the wave, swerves for a moment, tries to flee, but the rough caress of the paddle turns it, so it rushes forward, a shudder runs through the backbone of the wave, the sea drools and rumbles
- {:.pr} the canoe spins across the sand like a sleigh.

- {:.pr} At the end of this early morning, my virile prayer:
- {:.pr} give me the muscles of this canoe on the raging sea
- {:.pr} and the eloquent joy of the good news conch! 

- {:.pr} Here, I am just a man (that no degradation, nor spitting can shake)
- {:.pr} I'm no more than a man who accepts no longer being angry
- {:.pr} (he only has immense love in his heart)

- {:.pr} I accept ... I accept ... fully, without reservation …

- {:.pr} my race that no ablution of hyssop and lilies combined could purify
- {:.pr} my race gnawed at by macules
- {:.pr} my ripe grape race for drunken feet
- {:.pr} my queen of spit and lepers

- {:.pr} my queen of whips and scrofula
- {:.pr} my queen of squasms and melasma
- {:.pr} (oh, those queens I once loved in faraway springtime gardens with the illumination of all the chestnut candles behind them!).
- {:.pr} I accept. I accept.
- {:.pr} and the chastened Negro who says: "I’m sorry, master"
- {:.pr} and the twenty-nine legal lashes
- {:.pr} and the four foot high dungeon
- {:.pr} and the branched shackles
- {:.pr} and the sliced hamstring of my maroon audacity 
- {:.pr} and the fleur-de-lys flowing from the red-hot iron onto the fat of my shoulder
- {:.pr} and the doghouse of Mr. VAULTIER MAYENCOURT, where for six months I barked like a poodle for 
- {:.pr} and Monsieur BRAFIN
- {:.pr} and Monsieur de FOURNIOL
- {:.pr} and Monsieur de la MAHAUDIÈRE
- {:.pr} and the yaws
- {:.pr} the mastiff
- {:.pr} the suicide
- {:.pr} the promiscuity
- {:.pr} the ankle boot
- {:.pr} the stocks
- {:.pr} the rack
- {:.pr} the cippus
- {:.pr} the noose

- {:.pr} And my original geography too; the map of the world made for my use, not dyed with the arbitrary colors of scientists, but with the geometry of my spilled blood
- {:.pr} and the determination of my biology, not prisoner of a facial angle, a type of hair, a sufficiently flattened nose, a sufficiently melanian complexion, and Negritude, no longer a cephalic index, or a plasma, or a soma, but measured with the compass of suffering
- {:.pr} and the Negro every day lower, more cowardly, more sterile, less deep, more dispersed outward, more separated from itself, more cunning with itself, less immediate with itself

- {:.pr} I accept, I accept all of this 

- {:.pr} and far from the sea of ​​palaces that surges under the suppurating syzygy of he blisters, the body of my country lies marvelously in the despair of my arms, its bones shaken and in its veins, blood hesitates like the drop of vegetal milk in the wounded tip of the bulb ... And here suddenly strength and life assail me like a bull and I renew ONAN who entrusted his sperm to the fertile earth and the wave of life circumvents the papilla of the hillock, and here are all the veins and veinlets busy with new blood and the huge lung of cyclones breathing and the hoarded fire of volcanoes and the gigantic seismic pulse that now beats the measure of a living body in my firm embrace.
- {:.pr} And we are standing now, my country and I, hair in the wind, my hand small now in its huge fist and the strength is not in us, but above us, in a voice that twists the night and the listener like the penetrance of an apocalyptic wasp.
- {:.pr} And the voice says that Europe has for centuries fed us lies and swelled us with pestilence,
- {:.pr} because it is not true that the work of man is finished
- {:.pr} that we have nothing to do in the world
- {:.pr} that we parasitize the world
- {:.pr} that we just need to keep up the pace with the world 

- {:.pr} but the work of man has only just begun

- {:.pr} and it remains for man to conquer any injunction immobilized in the corners of his fervor
- {:.pr} and no race has a monopoly on beauty, intelligence, strength
- {:.pr} and there is room for all at the rendezvous of conquest and we now know that the sun revolves around our earth, illuminating the plot that our will alone has fixed, and that every star falls from heaven to earth at our limitless command.

- {:.pr} I now have the meaning of the ordeal: my country is the "night spear" of my Bambara ancestors.
- {:.pr} It shrivels and its tip flees desperately towards the handle if it is sprayed with chicken’s blood, and it says that the blood of man is needed for its temperament, fat, liver, human heart, not chicken blood. 
- {:.pr} And I look for my country, not for date seeds, but for the hearts of men who are to enter the silver cities by the big trapezoidal door, that they beat virile blood, and my eyes sweep my square kilometers of paternal land, and I count the wounds with a sort of joy like, and I pile them one on top of the other like rare species, and my count is always growing with unforeseen coins of baseness.
- {:.pr} And here are those who do not console themselves for not being made in the likeness of God but of the devil, those who consider that one is Negro like a second-class clerk: while waiting for better, and with the possibility of climbing higher; those wildly being just ahead of of themselves, those who live within the dungeon of themselves; those who drape themselves in proud pseudomorphosis; those who say to Europe: "See, I know how to bow to you, how to pay you respect, in short, I am no different from you; pay my dark skin no mind: it was the sun that burned me."

- {:.pr} And there is the black pimp, the black askari, and all zebras shake themselves in their own way to make their welts fall into the dew of fresh milk.
- {:.pr} And in the middle of it all I say hurray! my grandfather dies, I say hurray
- {:.pr} the old Negritude is gradually decaying.
- {:.pr} There is no need to say: he was a good Negro.
- {:.pr} The whites say he was a good Negro, a real good Negro, the good Negro to his good master.
- {:.pr} I say hurray!
- {:.pr} He was a very good Negro
- {:.pr} misery had hurt his chest and back and  his poor brain had been stuffed with the notion that some fatality weighed on him that could not be seized by the collar; that he had no power over his own destiny; that a wicked Lord had for all eternity written laws of interdiction in his pelvic nature; and to be the good Negro; to be genuinely content to be the good Negro; to believe genuinely in his unworthiness, without the perverse curiosity to ever verify the fateful hieroglyphics.
- {:.pr} He was a very good Negro
- {:.pr} and it did not occur to him that he could hoe, dig, cut everything, anything really, other than the tasteless cane

- {:.pr} He was a very good Negro.
- {:.pr} And they threw stones at him, pieces of iron, broken bottles, but neither these stones, nor this scrap iron, nor these bottles ...
- {:.pr} quiescent years of God on this earthly mound!

- {:.pr} And the whip fought with the bombing of the flies over the sweet dew of our wounds

- {:.pr} I say hurray! The old Negritude is progressively cadaverizing
- {:.pr} the horizon unravels, recedes and widens
- {:.pr} and here a dazzling sign appears through rifts in the clouds
- {:.pr} the slave ship breaks apart from all sides ... Its belly convulses and resounds ... The dreadful tapeworm of its cargo gnaws at the fetid guts of this strange infant of the seas!
- {:.pr} And neither the glee of the sails swollen like a plump pocket full of doubloons, nor the tricks played on the dangerous foolishness of the police frigates prevent it from hearing the threat of its rumbling intestines.
- {:.pr} Trying vainly to distract himself the captain hangs the loudest Negro from the top mast or throws him into the sea, or delivers him to the appetite of his hounds

- {:.pr} Smelling of fried onions the black masses discover the bitter taste of freedom in their spilled blood

- {:.pr}  And they are standing the black masses
- {:.pr}  the seated black masses
- {:.pr}  unexpectedly standing
- {:.pr}  standing in the hold
- {:.pr}  standing in the cabins
- {:.pr}  standing on the bridge
- {:.pr}  standing in the wind
- {:.pr}  standing under the sun
- {:.pr}  standing in blood
- {:.pr.i6} standing
- {:.pr.i9} and 
- {:.pr.i10} free
- {:.pr} standing and not at all the poor fools in their maritime freedom and destitution spinning in perfect drift
- {:.pr} and here it is:
- {:.pr} evermore unexpectedly standing
- {:.pr}  standing at the ropes
- {:.pr}  standing at the bar
- {:.pr}  standing at the compass
- {:.pr}  standing at the map
- {:.pr} standing under the stars
- {:.pr.i6} standing
- {:.pr.i9} and 
- {:.pr.i10} free

- {:.pr} and the lustral ship treads impassive on the exhausted waters.
 	
- {:.pr} And now fall
- {:.pr} and now rot our plop of ignominy

- {:.pr} mine are my dances
- {:.pr} my bad Negro dances
- {:.pr} the shackle-breaking dance
- {:.pr} the jail-break dance
- {:.pr} the it-is-beautiful-and-good-and-legitimate-to be-Negro dance
- {:.pr} Mine are my dances and the sun leaps on the racket of my hands 
- {:.pr} But no, the uneven sun is no longer enough for me
- {:.pr} wrap yourself, wind, around my new growth
- {:.pr} lay on my measured fingers
- {:.pr} I give you my conscience and its rhythm of flesh
- {:.pr} I deliver to you the fires where my weakness blazes
- {:.pr} I deliver to you the chain-gang 
- {:.pr} I deliver to you the swamp 
- {:.pr} I deliver to you the in-tourist of the triangular circuit
- {:.pr} Devour wind
- {:.pr} I deliver to you my abrupt words
- {:.pr} Devour and coil yourself up
- {:.pr} And as you coil up kiss me with a bigger thrill

- {:.pr} Kiss me until the furious we
- {:.pr} Kiss, kiss US
- {:.pr} But having also bitten us!
- {:.pr} Bitten us to the very blood of our blood!
- {:.pr} Kiss, my purity will only bind to your purity
- {:.pr} but go ahead and kiss!
- {:.pr} Like a field of righteous casuarinas
- {:.pr} the evening
- {:.pr} our multicolored purities.
- {:.pr} And bind, bind me without remorse
- {:.pr} bind me with your vast arms of luminous clay

- {:.pr} bind my black vibration to the very navel of the world
- {:.pr} Bind, bind me, bitter brotherhood
- {:.pr} Then strangling me with your lasso of stars
- {:.pr.i6}	rise, Dove
- {:.pr.i6}	rise
- {:.pr.i6}	rise
- {:.pr.i6}	rise
- {:.pr} I follow you, imprinted in my ancestral white cornea
- {:.pr} Rise, sky licker
- {:.pr} And that big black hole where I wanted to drown a moon ago
- {:.pr} Is where I now want to fish 
- {:.pr} the evil tongue of the night in its motionless verrition!
